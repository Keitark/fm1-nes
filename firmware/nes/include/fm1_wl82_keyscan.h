/* Physical SPI2 scanner for the stock-derived FM-1_010 pin assignment.
   start/poll/stop perform MMIO; construction/zero initialization does not.
   Caller must own SPI2, PA1/3/4/9/10, PH6/9 and the six column inputs exclusively,
   have established the board clocks/power, and supply a real monotonic clock.
   Zero-initialize the state before its first start. Call from ONE task, never
   an ISR for the legacy API. The opt-in async API below has explicit ISR and
   synchronization requirements. No stock-code calls are used. FM1_KEYSCAN_DMA2 selects
   two-byte DMA with polled completion and one shared persistent RAM source;
   there must be only ONE active scanner instance. Default is BUF byte polling.
   LED-multiplex outputs are kept low; encoder rotations are not decoded.
   Not enabled automatically by the headless boot image. Hardware unqualified. */
/* Failure-only snapshot, taken before stop resets SPI2/row/latch. reason is
   a bitmask: 1=elapsed-time limit, 2=poll limit, 4=task-observed IRQ no-progress.
   phase: 0=high, 1=low byte,
   2=whole DMA word. dma_count is readable CNT at failure, not proof of progress.
   Retained through stop/failed poll; cleared only by an accepted start.
   Same-task access only; callers must copy before publishing to other tasks. */
